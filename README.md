Github is a cloud-based platform that lets developers store, manage, and collaborate code using GIT. With Github developers can track changes in their codebase and work on different features using branches. To start using GitHub, GIT needs to be installed, and a repository must be used which acts as a storage location for the project. The repository is then cloned to the local computer. The project can be worked on locally and after making changes, they must be committed and saved to the local repository. Once committed, the changes can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub making it available to collaborators. To make sure local code is up to date, the latest updates can be pulled from the remote repository. Branching is an important part of working with Git. A branch is a separate copy of the project that lets the user work on new features without affecting the main codebase. When the user is finished, the branch can be merged back into the main project. Sometimes a merge conflict can occur which is when multiple people change the same code. The conflicts must be resolved manually before merging. The user can also fetch updates from a remote repository without automatically merging them, allowing the user to see the latest changes.

Visual Studio Code (vscode) is a source code editor. It supports multiple programming languages and offers features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and Git integration. Developers can clone repositories, commit chanes, push updates, and resolve merge conflicts directly within the editor. Vscode also contains a marketplace for extensions to help enhance functionality.

Branch - a separate version of a repository that allows developers to work on new features without affecting the main project.
Clone - cloning a repository creates a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.
Commit - a saved snapshot of changes made to a repository along with a message describing the update.
Fetch - retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository withut merging them into local code.
GIT - distrubted version control system that tracks changes in code and enables collaboration.
GitHub - cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and allows for version control and collaboration.
Merge - combines changes from one branch into another.
Merge Conflict - occurs when two branches have conflicting changes that must manually be resolved.
Push - sends committed changes from a local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
Pull - pulls updates from local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository.
Remote - a version of a repository stored on GitHub or another server.
Repository - storage location for a project that tracks all files, versions, and changes.
